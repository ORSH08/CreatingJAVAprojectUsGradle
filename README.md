# Creating a JAVA project using Gradle
You must create a JAVA project, using gradle init, similar to the project we created in class, and according to the lesson recording.
You need to create a new REPOSITORY in the bitbucket account and set it to private
You need to git save the project files and upload them to your new bitbucket REPOSITORY
You must upload the URL of your new repository to this submission box
You must give the repository read-only permissions to the course faculty, similar to how you shared the project from the previous assignment


You must add to the class code in the project a method that receives two numbers as parameters, and returns the result of a calculation operation of your choice, which the method performs on the two numbers.
For example, you can define a method named add that will return the sum of the numbers
You must change the main of the program so that it also activates the method you added
You must add automation tests to check whether your method correctly calculates the result of running the operation on different inputs that are sent to it
For each test of an edge case that is significantly different from other tests you have performed, you will be given an additional bonus:
For example, when testing the operation of adding two whole numbers, we will treat each of the following test cases as significantly different cases from each other:
Addition of 2 + 2 (two positive numbers)
Addition of 2 + 2- (two numbers, positive and negative, that add up to zero)
Addition of 2- + 2- (two negative numbers)
Addition of 2 + 5- (two numbers, positive and negative, which add up to a negative number)
Addition of 20 + 5- (two numbers, positive and negative, which add up to a positive number)
